# OctoPrint-YouTubeLive
**Overview:** Plugin that adds a tab to OctoPrint for viewing, starting, and stopping a YouTube Live stream. 

**Details:** Based on the work found [here](https://blog.alexellis.io/live-stream-with-docker/). Currently tested with OctoPrint running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and on a Pi3.

## Requirements for Streaming
Follow the instructions found [here](docker_instructions.md) to install and configure docker/mmjpeg for use with this plugin for Live streaming. This is not necessary if you just want to view a YouTube channel in a tab.

## Setup
Once installed enter your YouTube's channel id ([Advanced Account Settings](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced)) and your YouTube stream id ([YouTube Live Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard)) into the YouTube Live plugin settings.
